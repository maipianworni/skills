## Required Elements

### 1. Title with LEAF NODE Marker

The `[LEAF NODE]` marker signals the router that this is a terminal node.

```

### 2. Brief Description

One or two sentences explaining:
- What the skill does
- When it should be used

### 3. Workflow Steps

Numbered steps that Claude should follow:
- Each step should be actionable
- Include specific tool references when applicable
- Consider edge cases and error handling

### 4. Examples

Concrete examples help Claude understand:
- What user requests trigger this skill
- What actions to take
- What output to produce

### 5. Constraints

Important limitations or requirements:
- Scope boundaries
- Error conditions
- Dependencies
- Context requirements

## Complete Example

```markdown
# React Component Development [LEAF NODE]

This skill handles creating and modifying React components using functional
components with hooks. Use when the user requests React-specific development.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Requirements
- Analyze the user's request for component functionality
- Identify required props and state
- Consider component composition patterns

### Step 2: Create Component Structure
- Use functional component syntax with arrow functions
- Define TypeScript interfaces for props
- Set up necessary hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, etc.)

### Step 3: Implement Component Logic
- Follow React best practices
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect

### Step 4: Add Styling
- Use CSS modules or styled-components based on project convention
- Ensure responsive design principles

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Button Component
**User Request**: "Create a reusable button component"
**Action**:
1. Create `Button.tsx` with TypeScript props interface
2. Include variant props (primary, secondary, outline)
3. Add onClick handler prop
4. Create corresponding CSS module

### Example 2: Adding Form Validation
**User Request**: "Add validation to my login form"
**Action**:
1. Install/verify react-hook-form dependency
2. Add validation rules to form fields
3. Implement error message display
4. Add form submission handling

## Constraints

- Always use functional components, not class components
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing project conventions for styling
- Ensure accessibility (aria labels, keyboard navigation)

## Related Skills

- `css` - For styling and animations
- `typescript` - For type definitions
- `testing` - For component tests with Jest/React Testing Library
```

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each leaf should handle one coherent task type
2. **Clear Triggers**: Make it obvious when this skill should be used
3. **Actionable Steps**: Steps should be concrete actions, not vague guidelines
4. **Realistic Examples**: Use examples that match actual user requests
5. **Boundary Clarity**: Explicitly state what this skill does NOT do
6. **Self-Containment**: If this leaf is a reference node (feature dictionary, conversion table, API spec, etc.), **inline ALL data directly in this file**. Never create stub files that only contain a summary and a link to an external file. An agent loading only the tree must have everything needed to execute.
